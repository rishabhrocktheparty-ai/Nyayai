## Summary
This PR adds the initial scaffold for NYAY Setu (demo-ready) including:
- Citizen, Court Employee, Lawyer, Judge modules
- Auth (JWT cookie), OTP registration (dev stub)
- File uploads (S3 presigned), document/evidence hashing
- Background workers (BullMQ): analysis, podcast, notifications, anchor
- AI integration stubs (OpenAI) â€” all outputs flagged advisory and require legal review
- Blockchain anchor stub (DB + anchorId, txid:null)
- Notifications abstraction (SMS/WhatsApp/email)
- Observability (Sentry stub), healthcheck, structured logging
- CI workflows (lint, test, build) and deploy workflow
- Docs: `docs/arch.md`, `docs/runbook.md`, `docs/security.md`

> NOTE: All LLM-generated legal content is advisory only and requires qualified legal review before any production use.
